Carmicah Project
------------------
Compiled as a Static Library
Links with glfw3.lib, glad, ImGUI and freetype.lib
Uses "Dependencies/lib" for library directories
Uses "Carmicah/source" and "Dependencies/includes" for external include directories

------------------
Editor Project
------------------
Set as the start project, handles the running of the engine.
Compiled as a Console Application
Links with Carmicah project
Uses "Dependencies/lib" for library directories
Uses "Carmicah/source" for external include directories

------------------
glad Project
------------------
Compiled as a Static Library
Used to link with Carmicah Project to use Glad to support glfw
Made as a separate project due to pre-compiled header causing issues with the files if included in "Editor" project

------------------
ImGUI Project
------------------
Compiled as a Static Library
Used to link with Carmicah Project to use ImGUI for our level editor
Made as a separate project due to pre-compiled header causing issues with the files if included in "Editor" project
